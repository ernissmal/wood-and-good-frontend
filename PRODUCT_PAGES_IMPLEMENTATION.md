# Product Page Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented dynamic product pages for the Wood and Good e-commerce site that populate content from Sanity CMS data.

## Routes Created

### 1. `/products/[id]` Route
- **Location**: `src/app/products/[id]/`
- **Files**: 
  - `page.tsx` - Server component with `generateStaticParams`
  - `ProductClient.tsx` - Client component with interactive features
  - `loading.tsx` - Loading skeleton component
  - `not-found.tsx` - 404 page component

### 2. `/product/[id]` Route (Singular)
- **Location**: `src/app/product/[id]/`
- **Files**:
  - `page.tsx` - Server component with `generateStaticParams`
  - `ProductClient.tsx` - Client component with interactive features
  - `loading.tsx` - Loading skeleton component
  - `not-found.tsx` - 404 page component

## Features Implemented

### Product Display
- **Dynamic product loading** from Sanity CMS using product ID
- **Image gallery** with main image and thumbnails
- **Product information** including:
  - Name and category
  - Price or "Price on Request"
  - Detailed description
  - Technical specifications (dimensions, weight, color, finish)
  - Care instructions

### Interactive Features
- **Image selection** - Click thumbnails to change main image
- **Quantity selector** - Choose quantity before adding to cart
- **Add to cart** functionality with localStorage
- **Stock status** handling (in stock, out of stock)
- **Category filtering** links

### Navigation & UX
- **Breadcrumb navigation** (Home > Products > Product Name)
- **Related products** section showing 4 similar items from same category
- **Loading states** with skeleton components
- **Error handling** with user-friendly error messages
- **404 handling** for non-existent products

### CMS Integration
- **Sanity CMS** integration using existing hooks
- **Static generation** with `generateStaticParams` for all products
- **Product data structure** supporting:
  - Multiple images with alt text
  - Flexible dimensions (rectangular/oval tables, generic items)
  - Rich product specifications
  - Stock management
  - Category relationships

## Technical Implementation

### Server Components
- Used server components for SEO-friendly static generation
- Implemented `generateStaticParams` to pre-generate all product pages
- Compatible with `output: 'export'` for static site deployment

### Client Components
- Separated interactive functionality into client components
- Used React hooks for state management (image selection, quantity)
- Implemented localStorage for cart functionality

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS** classes for responsive design
- **Custom color scheme** using oak-themed colors
- **Mobile-first** responsive grid layouts
- **Loading animations** with pulse effects
- **Interactive states** with hover and focus styles

### Error Handling
- **Network errors** with retry suggestions
- **Product not found** with proper 404 pages
- **CMS connectivity** issues with user-friendly messages
- **Loading states** to prevent layout shifts

## URL Structure
- Primary route: `/product/{id}` (e.g., `/product/00001`)
- Alternative route: `/products/{id}` (for consistency with existing links)
- Both routes support the same functionality

## Integration Points

### Updated Files
- **Products page** (`src/app/products/page.tsx`) - Updated links to use `/product/{id}`
- **Existing hooks** - Leveraged `useSanityProduct` and `useSanityProducts`
- **Cart system** - Integrated with existing localStorage-based cart

### CMS Data Requirements
Products in Sanity CMS should have:
- `id` - Unique product identifier
- `name` - Product name
- `category` - Product category
- `price` - Numeric price (optional)
- `images` - Array of image URLs
- `imageAlts` - Array of alt text for images
- `detailedDescription` - Rich product description
- `specifications` - Object with dimensions, weight, color, finish, etc.
- `careInstructions` - Care and maintenance info
- `inStock` - Boolean stock status
- `featured` - Boolean for featured products

## Testing & Validation
- Compatible with Next.js 15+ App Router
- Works with static export configuration
- Responsive design tested across viewport sizes
- Error states and edge cases handled
- SEO-friendly with proper meta tags and structure

## Usage Examples
1. User clicks "View Details" on products page
2. Navigates to `/product/00001`
3. Views product images, specifications, and description
4. Adds item to cart with selected quantity
5. Sees related products and can navigate to them
6. Uses breadcrumbs to navigate back to products listing

The implementation provides a complete, production-ready product page system that integrates seamlessly with the existing Sanity CMS and Next.js architecture.
